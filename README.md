## Getting Started

To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd todo-list-app
    ```

3. Run the setup script:
    ```sh
    ./setup-and-run.sh
    ```

This script will:
- Check if Node.js and npm are installed.
- Install Node.js and npm if they are not installed.
- Install the project dependencies.
- Start the development server.
